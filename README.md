Hi Friend:

My name is Fabiola , I am 35 years old and I have  10 years experience in QA, I like this rol because I can interect with other areas, I consider myself loyal to my personal and professional principles, I am spontaneous and outgoing when I feel in confidence, I like talk whatever.

I like dogs so much that I usually talk to street the  dogs and touch them and usually tell them  ¿How are you? o ¿What is your name? Hahaha

My favorite food is green chilaquiles with a lot of cream, cheese, bread and coffe.
